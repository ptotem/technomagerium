                      <br>
                      That was all that remained. The universe, his beautiful creation, had ended. So utterly and
                      completely,
                      that it
                      was like it never existed.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      The Creator sighed. He had really hoped it would last longer than a few aeons this time around.
                      But his
                      creation
                      had disappointed him. Over the ages, he had allowed the Races knowledge, in the hope that they
                      would be
                      creators
                      themselves. But in that knowledge, the Races only saw power. Power that bred greed, a greed
                      which couldn't be
                      contained. The struggle to gain control of the universe had led to the creation of
                      unfathomable
                      weapons,
                      and unending wars. Until all that was left was empty space and the dust of once
                      powerful Races
                      floating around the universe.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Dust. The Creator walked slowly once again to the abandoned library at the edge of time. Dust was
                      enough
                      to start
                      with...
