It was what came after that disgusted him. This was a go'horkum, a creature which was very difficult to kill. The only way to keep a go'horkum dead, was to dismember him completely.

Gritting his teeth, he raised his broadsword and swung it down at the \r\n|p|\r\n</br></br></br>\r\nbody which had already started twitching and showing signs of reanimation.<br/><br/>The head first, he thought, as he severed the head clean from the body.

His blood.<br/><br/>The Warmonger stood and stared at the headless body of the Paladin. It had been a while since she had killed, and having done so it gave her a sense of accomplishment and even pleasure.

Which was unusual because the two realms were vastly separated and had no history of trade or diplomacy.

It was quiet and still and not a leaf was stirring. The Mystic sat back and settled into a more comfortable position. He might have to wait a while longer, he decided, as his thoughts went back to his audience with the great Creator.<br/><br/>\u201c You look inexperienced.\u201d, The Creator had said and the Mystic hadn't argued.

But the only things I am allowed to create are the ones I did in the Genesis. A world that I create then evolves of \r\n||\r\n</br></br></br>\r\nits own accord and in accordance to Designs unknown and seemingly random. But once every eon, the world creates a book that holds the key to the mysteries of these unknown Designs.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201c The purpose of the Eternals is to find and decipher these Creatomes. By doing this, you earn the privilege and responsibility of ushering in the next chapter in the progress of the Creation. In the early days of a Creation, the Tomes are simple, so it should be easy enough for a rookie such as yourself. But as the Creation ages, the designs become more and more difficult and often you will find yourself in a dilemma as to... but I get ahead of \r\n|p|\r\n</br></br></br>\r\nmyself.

He started running, leaping from tree to tree, his azure cloak flying in the wind behind him as the ground shuddered and trembled. Then with a deafening crack, the mountain top exploded and liquid fire erupted in a killing gush.<br/><br/>The Mystic took one last giant leap as the tree \r\n||\r\n</br></br></br>\r\nunder him caught fire and blackened instantly. Flying through the air, he twisted through the fiery rain and dove into the bubbling volcano. Like a spear he went, cutting through the emerging lava right to the bottom of the mountain. \r\n</br></br>\r\nHe landed on the burning floor of a large underground cavern and looked around to spot his target. The lava was bright and despite it being difficult to see anything clearly, he spotted a Tome floating in the burning yellow liquid not too far from where he stood. Hovering over the fiery river he reached out to pick up the Tome of Substance and \r\n|p|\r\n</br></br></br>\r\nbrushed the fire off it. <br/><br/>Then placing it inside his cloak, he blinked out of existence. <br/>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">***</p>\r\n",
